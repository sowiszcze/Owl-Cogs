# Credits
At this point of time all cogs are created by me, Sowiszcze, although I would like to thank all the people who inspired me to write those, especially my wonderful [Pokémon GO Szczecin community on Discord](https://discord.gg/QdbX2hM) for which most of those cogs were written in the first place.
